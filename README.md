# COVID-Prediction
This project uses R in Google Colaboratory to predict COVID-19 susceptibility to cases and deaths on the county level in 2022.
<br>
Around 1 GB of data and 110 variables were cleaned and used in a SuperLearner model to predict
COVID Cases, Deaths, Cases Per 100 People, and Deaths Per 100 People for 2830 out of 3007 counties in the United States. 
<br>
<br>
The final results were the following (red counties are most susceptible, light yellow are least susceptible, and grey did not have enough data):
